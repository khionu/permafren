# PermaFren - Object Permanence for Friends

Many of my fellow neurospicies know the pain of not maintaining friendships because of life and 
*waves hands vaguely* all this crap. This tool is meant to provide reminders to check in with 
friends that we both know you care about even if you can't keep them in your mind as much as you 
would like.

### Goals

- [ ] DB of friends/circles
  - Define how and how often to reach out
  - Presets and groups
  - (optional) contact details to help eg start email drafts for you
  - General notes section
  - Should have generic sync options, without SaaS
- [ ] Integration with online calendars
- [ ] Systemd Unit, Windows Service, Mac Launch Job
- [ ] GUI
  - Thinking [Slint](https://slint.dev/)
- [ ] CLI
  - Generic, but with `tui` and `api` commands.
    - TUI should have full-parity with GUI
    - API should provide output in JSON by default, have flag for CBOR, maybe others
